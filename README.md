Got tired of settings this up manually for all my projects.

If you want to use it (I don't know why you would) it's basically:

- eslint:recommended
- plugin:react/recommended
- plugin:prettier/recommended
    - arrow parens always
    - no bracket spacing
    - single quote
    - trailing comma always

`npm i --save-dev eslint-config-scwood`
